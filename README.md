# Insurances Claims Insights

This project is for a large insurance company who are due to undergo an internal audit with regards to their complaintâ€™s procedure.

They had a data warehouse and they dumped the data into a spreadsheet and I was asked to look at the model and produce insights for management level that can highlight any issues and prepare them for the audit.

 They gave the following scenarios to consider while creating the report:-
 
- The most recent 2 years of data is what most stakeholders are interested in
- The ability to see status changes and when they happened
- Complaints broken down by the dimensions
- Client Satisfaction
- Worst offending brokers
